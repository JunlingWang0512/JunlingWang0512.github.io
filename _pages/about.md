I am a Doctoral Fellow at ETH AI Center working on the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Human–computer interaction (HCI) by being part of the:

Language, Reasoning and Education Lab led by [Prof. Mrinmaya Sachan](https://inf.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.MjYyNzc4.TGlzdC8zMDQsLTg3NDc3NjI0MQ==.html), and
Programming, Education, and Computer-Human Interaction Lab led by [Prof. April Wang](https://ethz.ch/staffnet/en/organisation/who-is-who/infk/details.MzMyOTYx.TGlzdC8xOTA5LC01NDE4MTEwNzI=.html)

My research focuses on the in-depth analysis of the reasoning processes and capabilities of large language models (LLMs), with a particular emphasis on leveraging these models to construct advanced educational tutoring systems.
